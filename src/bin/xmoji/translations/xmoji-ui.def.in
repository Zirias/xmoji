These are workarounds/hacks to help some clients receiving the
faked key press events to correctly display emojis.

* Pre-ZWJ: If the emoji is a ZWJ sequence, prepend another
ZWJ. This is nonstandard, but helps some clients. If none of
the space options is active, a ZW space is also prepended.
* Add space: Add a regular space after each emoji
* Add ZW space: Add a zero-width space after each emoji

$w$waitBeforeDesc
.
Sending emojis as faked X11 key events requires temporarily
changing the keyboard mapping.
This is the time (in milliseconds) to wait after changing the
mapping and before sending the key press events.
This might help prevent possible race condition bugs in
clients between applying the new mapping and processing
the events.

$w$waitAfterDesc
.
Sending emojis as faked X11 key events requires temporarily
changing the keyboard mapping.
This is the time (in milliseconds) to wait after sending the
key press events and before resetting the keyboard mapping.
Some clients might apply a new keyboard map before processing
all queued events, so if you see completely unrelated
characters instead of the expected emojis, try increasing this
value.
Note that if you see multiple emojis instead of just one, this
value is unrelated, but the client has issues correctly
interpreting an emoji consisting of multiple codepoints.
